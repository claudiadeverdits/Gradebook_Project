# CSC212 Gradebook Project
## Team Members: Samuel Calise, Claudia Deverdits, Samuel Gryska, Grant Houatchanthara

#### Summary:
The purpose of our program’s objective is to replicate a gradebook for a student who is enrolled in CSC212. The program is compiled based on the following C++ classes driver.cpp, gradebook.cpp, and gradebook.h – these programs were developed and collaborated to replicate a gradebook structure for CSC212’s assignments. Through our group's planning and collaboration, this project will be capable of carrying out a variety of grades for assignments for enrolled students to see their individual, categorical, and overall grades visually.


#### Planning:
When planning our project’s direction in the driver and gradebook classes, below is a detailed outline of portions of code agreed upon and obligated to complete the problem’s resolution.  
        <<<Insert CLEAN planning format >>>


#### Documentation:
When compiling our driver.cpp class, we recommend using files local to the program’s directory of the IDE space. After compiling the driver.cpp and gradebook.cpp classes, please use the recommended text files in the directory. In case of an error when running the compilation’s executable and file in the terminal (separated by a space), the program will be capable of verifying if the file exists in the directory. After successfully entering the executable and text file name, a menu will be prompted to enter a specific integer to view the particular cases and a unique integer to terminate the program's runtime.
